# AltitudeAngelTest

My attempt for techical test.
Used Hilt, Retrofit, okhttpclient, moshi.
Used Jetpack compose.

if had more time:
- improved the design of UI as it more fuctional than looking good currently.
- imporved some error handling. areas wher i could be more specific in catching errors.
- more tests
- structucally may have split things into a more moudle style. e.g have network module, core module, feature module, etc.
